                Analysis of Baseball Lineups
            </li>
            <p>
                For this project, I analyzed the way in which baseball lineups are configured. As an avid baseball fan, I couldn't help but wonder if the standard way that lineups are configured is the most optimal way.

                As I progress through college and begin my proffessional career, there are a few goals that I have in mind. The first one being that I want to work with technology. Tech runs our world, and I want to help innovate to solve problems that may arise. I also want to create software that helps to solve problems.
